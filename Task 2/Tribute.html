        <p style="color:#000000"><strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong> (2 October 1869 &#45; 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer,
          anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead 
          the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule.He inspired movements for civil 
          rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), 
          first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.</p>

        <p style="color:#000000">
          Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns 
          for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, 
          above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with 
          hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor.

              <p style="color:#000000">At age 9, Gandhi entered the local school in Rajkot, near his home. There, he studied the 
                rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography.At the age of 11, he joined the 
                High School in Rajkot, Alfred High School.He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy
                 and tongue tied student, with no interest in games; his only companions were books
                  and school lessons.</p>
              <p style="color:#000000">
                n May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia 
                (her first name was usually shortened to "Kasturba", and affectionately to "Ba") 
                in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time.
                In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies.
              </p>
              <p style="color:#000000">Gandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay.Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and 
                family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London.</p>

                <p style="color:#000000"> he sailed from Bombay to London, with his brother seeing him off.Gandhi attended University 
                  College, London, where he took classes in English literature with Henry Morley in 1888–1889.
                  He also enrolled at the Inns of Court School of Law in Inner Temple with the intention of becoming a 
                  barrister. His childhood shyness and self-withdrawal had continued through his teens. 
                  He retained these traits when he arrived in London, 
                  but joined a public speaking practice group and overcame his shyness sufficiently to practise law.</p>

          Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[41] was born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family
          in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then 
          part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. 
          His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of 
          Porbandar state.His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was 
          then Junagadh State.
        </p>

        <p style="color:#000000">
          Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, 
          Karamchand proved a capable chief minister.[47] During his tenure, he married four times. His first 
          two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless.</p>

        <p style="color:#000000">In 1874, Gandhi's father Karamchand left Porbandar for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a 
          counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, 
          the British regional political agency was located there, which gave the state's diwan a measure of 
          security.In 1876, Karamchand became diwan of Rajkot
          and was succeeded as diwan of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. His family then rejoined him in Rajkot</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
        <p style="color:#000000">
          In November 1887, the 18-year-old Gandhi graduated from high school in Ahmedabad.In January 1888, 
          he enrolled at Samaldas College in Bhavnagar State, then the sole degree-granting institution 
          of higher education in the region. However, he dropped out, and returned to his family in Porbandar.
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000">
          He demonstrated a keen interest in the welfare of London's impoverished dockland communities. In 1889, 
          a bitter trade dispute broke out in London, with dockers striking for better pay
          and conditions, and seamen, shipbuilders, factory girls and other joining the strike in solidarity.

        </div>
        <p style="color:#000000">
          The strikers were successful, in part due to the mediation of Cardinal Manning, leading Gandhi 
          and an Indian friend to make a point of visiting the cardinal and thanking him for his work.
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000">In April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin.
           He spent 21 years in South Africa, where he developed his political views, ethics and politics.
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000">Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the 
          Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his 
          restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took 
          Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.

              <p style="color:#000000">Gandhi participated in forming the Indian Ambulance Corps in the South African war against the Boers, 
                on the British side in 1899.Both the Dutch settlers called Boers and the imperial British at that 
                time discriminated against the coloured races they considered as inferior, and Gandhi later wrote about 
                his conflicted beliefs during the Boer war. He stated that "when the war was declared, my personal 
                sympathies were all with the Boers, but my loyalty to the British rule drove me to participation with the British in that war.</p>
            
              <p style="color:#000000">During World War I (1914–1918), nearing the age of 50, Gandhi supported the British and its allied forces 
                by recruiting Indians to join the British army, expanding the Indian contingent from about 100,000 to 
                over 1.1 million.He encouraged Indian people to fight on one side of the war in Europe 
                and Africa at the cost of their lives.</p>
              
              <p style="color:#000000">After World War II engulfed Britain, Gandhi actively campaigned to oppose any help to the British war 
                effort and any Indian participation in the war by launching Quit India Movement. According to Arthur 
                Herman, Gandhi believed that his campaign would strike a blow to imperialism.The British government 
                responded with mass arrests including that of Gandhi and Congress leaders and killed over 1,000 Indians who participated in this movement.</p>

              <p style="color:#000000">Gandhi was a prolific writer. His signature style was simple, precise, clear and as devoid of 
                artificialities. One of Gandhi's earliest publications, Hind Swaraj, 
                published in Gujarati in 1909, became "the intellectual blueprint" for India's independence movement. </p>
              
                <p style="color:#000000">The book was translated into English the next year, with a copyright legend that read "No Rights 
                Reserved".For decades he edited several newspapers including Harijan in Gujarati, in Hindi and 
                in the English language; Indian Opinion while in South Africa and, Young India, in English, and Navajivan, 
                a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India. Later, Navajivan was also
                 published in Hindi. In addition, he wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers.</p>

                <p style="color:#000000">Gandhi also wrote several books including his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth 
                  (Gujarātī "સત્યના પ્રયોગો અથવા આત્મકથા"), of which he bought the entire first edition to make sure it was 
                  reprinted.His other autobiographies included: Satyagraha in South Africa about his struggle there,
                  Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule, a political pamphlet, and 
                  a paraphrase in Gujarati of John Ruskin's Unto This Last which was an early critique of political economy.</p>

                Gandhi is noted as the greatest figure of the successful Indian independence movement 
                against the British rule. He is also hailed as the greatest figure of modern India.American historian 
                Stanley Wolpert described Gandhi as "India's greatest revolutionary nationalist leader" and the greatest 
                Indian since the Buddha. In 1999, Gandhi was named "Asian of the century" 
                by Asiaweek.In a 2000 BBC poll, he was voted as the greatest man of the millennium.

              <p style="color:#000000">Gandhi influenced important leaders and political movements.Leaders of the civil rights movement in the 
                United States, including Martin Luther King Jr.James Lawson, and James Bevel, 
                drew from the writings of Gandhi in the development of their own theories about nonviolence.</p>

              <p style="color:#000000"> Gandhi's life and teachings inspired many who specifically referred to Gandhi as their mentor or 
                who dedicated their lives to spreading Gandhi's ideas. In Europe, Romain Rolland was the first to 
                discuss Gandhi in his 1924 book Mahatma Gandhi, and Brazilian anarchist and feminist Maria Lacerda 
                de Moura wrote about Gandhi in her work on pacifism. In 1931, physicist Albert Einstein exchanged 
                letters with Gandhi, and called him "a 
                role model for the generations to come" in a letter writing about him.</p>
              
                

              
              <p style="color:#000000">Indians widely describe Gandhi as the father of the nation.Origin of this title is traced 
                back to a radio address (on Singapore radio) on 6 July 1944 by Subhash Chandra Bose where Bose 
                addressed Gandhi as "The Father of the Nation".On 28 April 1947, Sarojini Naidu during a conference 
                also referred Gandhi as "Father of the Nation".He is also conferred the title "Bapu"(Gujarati: 
                endearment for father,papa).</p>

                Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated by 
                Nathuram Godse on the steps of the Birla House in New Delhi.</p>

                <p style="color:#000000">Godse was captured by members of the crowd—the most widely reported of whom was Herbert Reiner Jr,
                   a vice-consul at the American embassy in Delhi—and handed over to the police. The Gandhi murder 
                   trial opened in May 1948 in Delhi's historic Red Fort, with Godse the main defendant, and his 
                   collaborator Narayan Apte, and six more, deemed co-defendants. The trial was rushed through, 
                   the haste sometimes attributed to the home minister 
                  Vallabhbhai Patel's desire "to avoid scrutiny for the failure to prevent the assassination."</p>
